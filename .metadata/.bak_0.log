	여기서 업무라는 것은 데이터베이스와 관련된 처리 업무를 말하는 것으로 Model 단에서 작성된 메소드를 말하는 것이다.

	// ※ 의존객체주입(DI : Dependency Injection)
	// ==> 스프링 프레임워크는 객체를 관리해주는 컨테이너를 제공해주고 있다.
	// 스프링 컨테이너는 bean으로 등록되어진 BoardController 클래스 객체가 사용되어질때,
	// BoardController 클래스의 인스턴스 객체변수(의존객체)인 BoardService service 에
	// 자동적으로 bean 으로 등록되어 생성되어진 BoardService service 객체를
	// BoardController 클래스의 인스턴스 변수 객체로 사용되어지게끔 넣어주는 것을 의존객체주입(DI : Dependency
	// Injection)이라고 부른다.
	// 이것이 바로 IoC(Inversion of Control == 제어의 역전) 인 것이다.
	// 즉, 개발자가 인스턴스 변수 객체를 필요에 의해 생성해주던 것에서 탈피하여 스프링은 컨테이너에 객체를 담아 두고,
	// 필요할 때에 컨테이너로부터 객체를 가져와 사용할 수 있도록 하고 있다.
	// 스프링은 객체의 생성 및 생명주기를 관리할 수 있는 기능을 제공하고 있으므로, 더이상 개발자에 의해 객체를 생성 및 소멸하도록 하지 않고
	// 객체 생성 및 관리를 스프링 프레임워크가 가지고 있는 객체 관리기능을 사용하므로 Inversion of Control == 제어의 역전
	// 이라고 부른다.
	// 그래서 스프링 컨테이너를 IoC 컨테이너라고도 부른다.

	// IOC(Inversion of Control) 란 ?
	// ==> 스프링 프레임워크는 사용하고자 하는 객체를 빈형태로 이미 만들어 두고서 컨테이너(Container)에 넣어둔후
	// 필요한 객체사용시 컨테이너(Container)에서 꺼내어 사용하도록 되어있다.
	// 이와 같이 객체 생성 및 소멸에 대한 제어권을 개발자가 하는것이 아니라 스프링 Container 가 하게됨으로써
	// 객체에 대한 제어역할이 개발자에게서 스프링 Container로 넘어가게 됨을 뜻하는 의미가 제어의 역전
	// 즉, IOC(Inversion of Control) 이라고 부른다.
